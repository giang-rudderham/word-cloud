Sentiment analysis applied on stock tweets.

I applied sentiment analysis to analyze tweets collected from Twitter, in order to study the collective mood about two companies in the technology industry, Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc. I also developed an R Shiny app that displays word clouds for Yahoo! Inc., Google Inc., and Apple Inc., in order to give an insight into key words associated with these companies on Twitter.
